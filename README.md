CodeAttic
=========

Old iPhone code i found in the attic (mainly from my old blog http://www.applausible.com which might be gone)

Note: This shit is old!!! So don't complain if it's not current, doesn't work or breaks randomly! It worked at the time, circa 2010.


Youtube iPhone Popup
==========================

* JHYoutubeView, which you can just feed in the Youtube video code and frame size required, so feel free to use it.
* Also to note, this only works in the device, so if it’s not showing in the simulator, try it on the device.

iPhone Typewriter Animation
==========================

* A Typewriter animation view that works by adding a UILabel letter by letter on a NSTimer (actually i use FontLabel here to give it a cool typewriter-y look).

RoundedPopup
==========================

* A really nice code example here of Cocos2d Box2d for all ye game devs out there!
* I ported a Emanuele Feronato Flash ActionScript example to Cocos2d for the iPhone.
* It uses 2 b2RevoluteJoint to act front wheels to enable turning and 2 b2PrismaticJointDef to act as driving force for the car. I added a the freely available SneakyJoystick to drive the car(it’s very simple) but driving could be optimised for other controls.
